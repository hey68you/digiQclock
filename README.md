- this is not packaged, so you have to unzip to a writeable folder
- you can open and edit the ```digiQclock.qml``` file (mostly for colors or change the font)
- you will need to have installed these Qt libs (should work if you've installed my latest HiQDock package from github (https://github.com/hey68you/hiqdock-distro) or from BeSly 64 repo (http://software.besly.de/repo64):
- ```requires {
    lib:libqt6core >= 6.7.2
    lib:libqt6network >= 6.7.2
    lib:libqt6Qml >= 6.7.2
    lib:libqt6gui >= 6.7.2
    lib:libqt6openGL >= 6.7.2
	lib:libqt6quick >= 6.7.2
	lib:libqt6widgets >= 6.7.2
	lib:libqt6quickwidgets >= 6.7.2
}```
